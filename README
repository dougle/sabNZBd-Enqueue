A sabNZBd+ API using script to add a file to sabnzbd+

Installing:
$ wget http://github.com/dougle/sabNZBd-Enqueue/raw/master/sabnzbd_enqueue -o /usr/bin/sabnzbd_enqueue && \
  chmod +x /usr/bin/sabnzbd_enqueue

This script uses notify-send for the messages which is in libnotify-bin package
$ aptitude install libnotify-bin && notify-send 'libnotify', 'Libnotify has been installed'

Currently it reads in your sabnzb config (assumed to be at ~/.sabnzbd/sabnzbd.ini) and uses it for most settings, the future aim of this script is to be totally reliant on sabs config and not require any setting up of it's own.

Usage:
$ sabnzbd_enqueue "/abs/path/to/file.nzb"

From nautilus you can view an nzb file's properties and associate sabnzbd_enqueue with it in the "open with" tab, this will then work nicley system wide.

Personnally i set chromium and firefox to open these files via sabnzbd_enqueue as soon as they are downloaded, which works pretty smoothly.

Well done to the sabnzbd+ people.

Next to come is a lightweight panel applet to see sabnzbd+ queue and status.
